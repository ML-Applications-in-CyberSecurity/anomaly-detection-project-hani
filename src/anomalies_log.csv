8080,5572,1441,273,TCP,Label: Borderline Large Packet,"Reason: The packet size of 1441 bytes is considered borderline suspicious because it is close to the upper limit of the normal range (1500 bytes), even though it is still within the acceptable range. This proximity to the boundary warrants closer inspection, as large packets can potentially be used to evade security controls or transfer malicious data. However, since the packet size is not excessively large and other parameters (source port, duration, and protocol) are within normal ranges, it is not immediately classified as a high-risk anomaly.",0.5978966062240899
8080,56407,1387,117,UDP,Label: Borderline Large Packet,"Reason: The packet size of 1387 bytes is close to the upper limit of the normal range (1500 bytes), which may indicate a potentially risky or borderline suspicious transmission, even though it's still within the acceptable range.

443,60541,6037,70,TCP,Label: Large Packet,"Reason: The packet size of 6037 bytes is significantly above the normal range of 100 to 1500 bytes, indicating a potential anomaly that could be related to malicious activity, such as data exfiltration or denial-of-service attacks. Although other parameters like src_port, duration_ms, and protocol are within normal ranges, the unusually large packet size raises concerns about the nature of the traffic.",0.6070627947691478

8080,61318,643,495,TCP,Label: Borderline Suspicious Duration,"Reason: The packet size is within the normal range, the source port is typical, and the protocol is normal (TCP).
